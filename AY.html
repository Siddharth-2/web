    <h1>Social Anxiety Disorder</h1>
    <h2>Information</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
    <p>Social anxiety disorder, sometimes referred to as social phobia, is a type of anxiety disorder
        that causes extreme fear in social settings. People with this disorder have trouble talking to people, meeting
        new people, and attending social gatherings. They fear being judged or scrutinized by others. They may
        understand that their fears are irrational or unreasonable, but feel powerless to overcome them.</p>

    <p>Social anxiety is different from shyness. Shyness is usually short-term and doesn’t disrupt one’s life. Social
        anxiety is persistent and debilitating. It can affect one’s ability to:

        <li>work</li>
        <li>attend school</li>
        <li>develop close relationships with people outside of their family</li>
        According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) approximately 15 million American adults
        have social anxiety disorder. Symptoms of this disorder may start around the age of 13.
    </p>
    <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
    <p><b>1.Social interaction may cause the following physical symptoms:</b></p>
    <li>blushing</li>
    <li>nausea</li>
    <li>excessive sweating</li>
    <li>trembling or shaking</li>
    <li>difficulty speaking</li>
    <li>dizziness or lightheadedness</li>
    <li>rapid heart rate</li>
    <p><b>Psycological Symptoms may include:</b></p>
    <li>worrying intensely about social situations</li>
    <li>worrying for days or weeks before an event</li>
    <li>avoiding social situations or trying to blend into the background if you must attend</li>
    <li>worrying about embarrassing yourself in a social situation</li>
    <li>worrying that other people will notice you are stressed or nervous</li>
    <li>needing alcohol to face a social situation</li>
    <li>missing school or work because of anxiety</li>
    <p>It is normal to sometimes feel anxious. However, when you have social phobia, you have a constant fear of being
        judged by others or humiliated in front of them. You may avoid all social situations, including:</p>
    <li>asking a question</li>
    <li>job interviews</li>
    <li>shopping</li>
    <li>using public restrooms</li>
    <li>talking on the phone</li>
    <li>eating in public</li>
    Symptoms of social anxiety may not occur in all situations. You can have limited or selective anxiety. For example,
    symptoms may only occur when you’re eating in front of people or talking to strangers. Symptoms can occur in all
    social settings if you have an extreme case.
    </p>

    <h2>Solutions:</h2>
    <p class="para">
    <p>Several types of treatment are available for social anxiety disorder. Treatment results differ from person to
        person. Some people only need one type of treatment. However, others may require more than one. Your healthcare
        provider may refer you to a mental health provider for treatment. Sometimes, primary care providers may suggest
        medication to treat symptoms.</p>

    <p> Treatment options for social anxiety disorder include:</p>
    <p><b>1.Cognitive behavioral therapy</b>
        This therapy helps you learn how to control anxiety through relaxation and breathing, and how to replace
        negative thoughts with positive ones.
    </p>
    <p><b>2.Exposure therapy</b>
        This type of therapy helps you gradually face social situations, rather than avoiding them
    </p>
    <p><b>Group therapy</b>
        This therapy helps you learn social skills and techniques to interact with people in social settings.
        Participating in group therapy with others who have the same fears may make you feel less alone. It will give
        you a chance to practice your new skills through role-playing.
    </p>
    <p>At-home treatments include:</p>
    <p><b>1.Avoiding caffeine</b>
        Foods such as coffee, chocolate, and soda are stimulants and may increase anxiety.
    </p>
    <p><b>Getting plenty of sleep</b>
        Getting at least eight hours of sleep per night is recommended. Lack of sleep can increase anxiety and worsen
        symptoms of social phobia.
