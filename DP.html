    <h1>Depression </h1>
    <h2>Information</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively
        affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes
        feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of
        emotional and physical problems and can decrease your ability to function at work and at home.
    <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
        Depression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:

        <li>Feeling sad or having a depressed mood.</li>
        <li>Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed.</li>
        <li>Changes in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting.</li>
        <li>Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much.</li>
        <li>Loss of energy or increased fatigue.</li>
        <li>Increase in purposeless physical activity (e.g., inability to sit still, pacing, handwringing) or
            slowed movements or speech (these actions must be severe enough to be observable by others).</li>
        <li>Feeling worthless or guilty.</li>
        <li>Difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions.</li>
        <li>Thoughts of death or suicide.</li>
    </p>

    <h2>Solutions:</h2>
    <p class="para"> <p>Here are the 5 most common solutions for depression:</p>



    <p><b>1. Medication</b>: The most common treatment for depression is the use of antidepressants. These drugs work by
        balancing chemicals in your brain called neurotransmitters that affect mood and emotions. There are several
        categories of antidepressants. The best way to find out which one could work for you is consulting your
        psychiatrist or physician and obtaining a prescription. These drugs normally take 2 to 4 weeks before you will
        notice a change in your mood. Most people with depression find that medication works.</p>

    <p> <b>2. Therapy</b>: Therapy can be a very effective treatment for depression. Most therapists require you meet with them
        in person on a regular basis or over the Internet via telecommunication. Weekly sessions can help you deal with
        stressful situations, address your negative beliefs, cope with challenges, and increase your self-esteem—all of
        which help in treating depression. There are other types of therapy that have also proven helpful, such as
        Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, and Group Therapy, the latter of
        which provides a safe environment to share your feelings with people who can relate to what you’re going through
        and it helps to not feel so alone.</p>

    <p> <b>3. Lifestyle Changes</b>: In addition to medication and therapy changing some of your negative behaviors and habits
        can help with treating depression.</p>

        Some of these changes would be:

        <li>Get a Routine: When you’re depressed your days become similar in their lack of enjoyment and hard to distinguish
        from one another. Setting a daily schedule can help you get active and become involved with your life. Your
        routine could include: getting up at the same time every day, scheduling an activity for each night of the week,
        and making one phone call a day to a supportive friend or relative.</li>

        <li>Set Goals: A major symptom of depression is the sense you can't accomplish anything and because of that you feel
        bad about yourself. Setting small daily goals such as making the bed, taking a shower, or going for a walk can
        help. By completing small contrary acts you’ll feel better about your abilities and in turn feel better about
        yourself.</li>

        <li>Eat Healthy: When you’re depressed the last thing you probably want to do is eat healthy. Regrettably eating
        overly processed foods like fast foods and sugary sweets may be adding to your depression. Processed foods
        contain refined carbohydrates that have no nutritional value, and unhealthy levels of sugar and salt. Clinical
        studies have found that a diet high in refined foods impairs brain function and encourages depression. Eating
        healthy foods has been shown to reverse these issues. What you eat directly affects your brain and your mood.</li>

        <li>Avoid Drugs and Alcohol: People who suffer from depression desperately want to alter the way they feel. Many
        turn to drugs and alcohol as a solution. Unfortunately alcohol, tranquilizers, and opiates act as depressant to
        your nervous system and make your symptoms worse. Amphetamines can give the illusion they reduce depression,
        however the come down, the physical toll on your body, and the withdrawal, result in an even worse depression.
        Adding drugs to your already depressed system never helps.</li>

        <li>Exercise: Regular exercise boosts the naturally produced endorphins that your body uses to help you feel better
        and less depressed. Endorphins interact with your brain’s receptors and trigger positive feelings. Exercising,
        especially outdoors and in sunlight, invigorates your body. You don’t need to compete in a triathlon; something
        as simple as walking for an hour every other day can help get your endorphins flowing.</li>

        <li>Sleep: It’s recommended you get 6 to 8 hours of sleep a night. But depression can make it hard to sleep, and
        with too little sleep your depression can get worse. This is where setting a routine can help. Try going to bed
        and getting up at the same time every day. Do not take naps as they can alter your sleep schedule. Sometimes,
        getting rid of the distractions you engage in at night before sleep—watching TV, looking at your cell phone, or
        shopping on your computer—helps to calm your mind and it’s easier to get a good night’s sleep.</li>



    <p><b>4. Meditation</b>: Stress and anxiety are major triggers for depression, and meditation has been proven to alter
        your reaction to those feelings. When you’re stressed the body produces a hormone called cortisol, and
        meditation lowers cortisol. During meditation your brain is also producing theta waves that usually only occur
        when you’re asleep, and alpha waves like when you’re daydreaming. When your body gets as relaxed as when it’s
        sleeping or daydreaming it starts producing dopamine; a neurotransmitter that’s released into your body during
        pleasurable situations. If you add all those together meditation is probably the best natural treatment for
        reducing depression.</p> 



    <p><b>5. Challenging Negative Thoughts</b>: A lot of the work in treating depression is changing how you think. When
        you're depressed, you embrace worst-case scenarios and obsessively dwell on the negative. Challenging these
        negative thoughts is a common treatment for depression. You feel no one loves you, but what real evidence do you
        have? You think you’re a worthless horrible person, but is that really the truth? Try challenging these beliefs
        and ideas. When the thoughts come say, “no, we’re not doing this today.” When you’re telling yourself what a
        terrible person you are, think about how you would respond if a friend talked about themselves that way. You
        would probably tell them to stop being so negative. Apply the same logic to your own thoughts. It takes
        practice, but if you address the negative thoughts head on, don’t embrace them, or indulge, they’ll eventually
        become less persuasive.</p>

        The majority of people suffering from depression will not see a doctor or a therapist or ask anyone for help.
        Left untreated, depression can be detrimental to your mental and physical health. The over all consequences are
        not worth the risk. If you are depressed, feel that you may be depressed, or just can’t seem to find joy in
        anything—its probably time you talked with a professional.
