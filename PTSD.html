    <h1>Post Traumatic Stress Disorder </h1>
    <h2>Information</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that's triggered by a
        terrifying event â€” either experiencing it or witnessing it. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares and
        severe anxiety, as well as uncontrollable thoughts about the event.

    <p>Most people who go through traumatic events may have temporary difficulty adjusting and coping, but with time
        and good self-care, they usually get better. If the symptoms get worse, last for months or even years, and
        interfere with your day-to-day functioning, you may have PTSD.</p>

    <p>Getting effective treatment after PTSD symptoms develop can be critical to reduce symptoms and improve function.
    </p>

    <p>Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may start within one month of a traumatic event, but sometimes symptoms
        may not appear until years after the event. These symptoms cause significant problems in social or work.</p>
    <h2>Symptoms</h2>
    <p>PTSD symptoms are generally grouped into four types: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking
        and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions. Symptoms can vary over time or vary from person to
        person</p>
    <p>
        <b>1.Intrusive memories</b>
    <p>Symptoms of intrusive memories may include:</p>
    <li>Recurrent, unwanted distressing memories of the traumatic event</li>
    <li>Reliving the traumatic event as if it were happening again (flashbacks)</li>
    <li>Upsetting dreams or nightmares about the traumatic event</li>
    <li>Severe emotional distress or physical reactions to something that reminds you of the traumatic event</p>
        <p>
    <b>2.Avoidance</b>

    <p>Symptoms of avoidance may include:</p>

    <li>Trying to avoid thinking or talking about the traumatic event</li>
    <li>Avoiding places, activities or people that remind you of the traumatic event</li>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>3.Negative Changes in Thinking and Mood</b>

    <p>Symptoms of negative changes in thinking and mood may include:</p>

    <li>Negative thoughts about yourself, other people or the world</li>
    <li>Hopelessness about the future</li>
    <li>Memory problems, including not remembering important aspects of the traumatic event</li>
    <li>Difficulty maintaining close relationships</li>
    <li>Feeling detached from family and friends</li>
    <li>Lack of interest in activities you once enjoyed</li>
    <li>Difficulty experiencing positive emotions</li>
    <li>Feeling emotionally numb</li>
    </p>
    <b>4.Changes in physical and emotional reactions</b>

    <p>Symptoms of changes in physical and emotional reactions (also called arousal symptoms) may include:</p>

    <li>Being easily startled or frightened</li>
    <li>Always being on guard for danger</li>
    <li>Self-destructive behavior, such as drinking too much or driving too fast</li>
    <li>Trouble sleeping</li>
    <li>Trouble concentrating</li>
    <li>Irritability, angry outbursts or aggressive behavior</li>
    <li>Overwhelming guilt or shame</li>
    </p>

    <h2>Solutions:</h2>
    <p class="para"> Here are some solutions for PTSD :
    <p>
        <b>1.Therapy</b>
        <p>PTSD therapy has three main goals:</p>
        <li>Improve your symptoms </li>
        <li>Teach you skills to deal with it</li>
        <li> Restore yourself-esteem </li>
        Most PTSD therapies fall under the umbrella of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The idea is
        to change the thought patterns that are disturbing your life. This might happen through talking about your
        trauma or concentrating on where your fears come from. Depending on your situation, group or family therapy
        might be a good choice for you instead of individual sessions.
    </p>
    <p><b>2.Cognitive Processing Therapy</b></p>
    <p>CPT is a 12-week course of treatment, with weekly sessions of 60-90 minutes.</p>

    <p>At first, you'll talk about the traumatic event with your therapist and how your thoughts related to it have
    affected your life. Then you'll write in detail about what happened. This process helps you examine how you think
    about your trauma and figure out new ways to live with it.</p>

    <p>For example, maybe you've been blaming yourself for something. Your therapist will help you take into account all
    the things that were beyond your control, so you can move forward, understanding and accepting that, deep down, it
    wasn't your fault, despite things you did or didn't do.</p>
