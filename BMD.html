    <h1>Bipolar Disorder</h1>
    <h2>Information</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
    <p>Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings
        that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression).</p>

    <p>When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. When
        your mood shifts to mania or hypomania (less extreme than mania), you may feel euphoric, full of energy or
        unusually irritable. These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to
        think clearly.</p>

    <p>Episodes of mood swings may occur rarely or multiple times a year. While most people will experience some
        emotional symptoms between episodes, some may not experience any.</p>

    <p>Although bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, you can manage your mood swings and other symptoms by
        following a treatment plan. In most cases, bipolar disorder is treated with medications and psychological
        counseling (psychotherapy).</p>

    <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
    <p>
    <p>There are several types of bipolar and related disorders. They may include mania or hypomania and depression.
        Symptoms can cause unpredictable changes in mood and behavior, resulting in significant distress and difficulty
        in life.</p>
    <p><b>1.Bipolar I disorder:</b>
        You've had at least one manic episode that may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive
        episodes. In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality (psychosis).
    </p>
    <p><b>2.Bipolar II disorder. </b>
        You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but you've never had a
        manic episode.
    </p>
    <p><b>3.Cyclothymic disorder.</b>
        You've had at least two years — or one year in children and teenagers — of many periods of hypomania symptoms
        and periods of depressive symptoms (though less severe than major depression).
    </p>

    </p>

    <h2>Solutions:</h2>
    <p class="para">
        Bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition. Treatment is directed at managing symptoms. Depending on your needs,
        treatment may include:
    </p>
    <p><b>1.Medications. </b>
        Often, you'll need to start taking medications to balance your moods right away.
    </p>
    <p><b>2.Continued treatment.</b>
        Bipolar disorder requires lifelong treatment with medications, even during periods when you feel better. People
        who skip maintenance treatment are at high risk of a relapse of symptoms or having minor mood changes turn into
        full-blown mania or depression.
    </p>
    <p><b>3.Day treatment programs. </b>
        Your doctor may recommend a day treatment program. These programs provide the support and counseling you need
        while you get symptoms under control.
    </p>
    <p><b>4.Substance abuse treatment. </b>
        If you have problems with alcohol or drugs, you'll also need substance abuse treatment. Otherwise, it can be
        very difficult to manage bipolar disorder.
    </p>
    <p><b>5.Hospitalization.</b>
        Your doctor may recommend hospitalization if you're behaving dangerously, you feel suicidal or you become
        detached from reality (psychotic). Getting psychiatric treatment at a hospital can help keep you calm and safe
        and stabilize your mood, whether you're having a manic or major depressive episode
