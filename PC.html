    <h1>Panic Disorders </h1>
    <h2>Information</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">People with panic disorder have sudden and repeated attacks of fear that last for several
        minutes or longer. These are called panic attacks. Panic attacks are characterized by a fear of disaster or of
        losing control even when there is no real danger. A person may also have a strong physical reaction during a
        panic attack. It may feel like having a heart attack. Panic attacks can occur at any time, and many people with
        panic disorder worry about and dread the possibility of having another attack.

        A person with panic disorder may become discouraged and feel ashamed because he or she cannot carry out normal
        routines like going to school or work, going to the grocery store, or driving.

        Panic disorder often begins in the late teens or early adulthood. More women than men have panic disorder. But
        not everyone who experiences panic attacks will develop panic disorder.</p>
    <p>Panic disorder sometimes runs in families, but no one knows for sure why some family members have it while others
        don’t. Researchers have found that several parts of the brain, as well as biological processes, play a key role
        in fear and anxiety. Some researchers think that people with panic disorder misinterpret harmless bodily
        sensations as threats. By learning more about how the brain and body functions in people with panic disorder,
        scientists may be able to create better treatments. Researchers are also looking for ways in which stress and
        environmental factors may play a role.
        <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
        People with panic disorder may have:

        <li>Sudden and repeated panic attacks of overwhelming anxiety and fear.</li>
        <li>A feeling of being out of control, or a fear of death or impending doom during a panic attack.</li>
        <li>Physical symptoms during a panic attack, such as a pounding or racing heart, sweating, chills, trembling,
            breathing problems, weakness or dizziness, tingly or numb hands, chest pain, stomach pain, and nausea.</li>
        <li>An intense worry about when the next panic attack will happen.</li>
        <li>A fear or avoidance of places where panic attacks have occurred in the past.</li>
    </p>

    <h2>Solutions:</h2>
    <p class="para"> First, talk to your doctor about your symptoms. Your doctor should do an exam and ask you about
        your
        health history to make sure that an unrelated physical problem is not causing your symptoms. Your doctor may
        refer to you a mental health specialist, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist.

        Panic disorder is generally treated with psychotherapy, medication, or both. Talk with your doctor about the
        best treatment for you.

        <p> <b>1.Psychotherapy</b>: A type of psychotherapy called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is especially
            useful as a
            first-line treatment for panic disorder. CBT teaches you different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting
            to
            the feelings that come on with a panic attack. The attacks can begin to disappear once you learn to react
            differently to the physical sensations of anxiety and fear that occur during panic attacks.</p>

        <p> <b>2.Medication</b>: Doctors also may prescribe different types of medications to help treat panic
            disorder:

        <li> Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).</li>
        <li>Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).</li>
        <li>Beta-blockers</li>
        <li>Benzodiazepines</li>
        SSRIs and SNRIs are commonly used to treat depression, but they are also helpful for the symptoms of panic
        disorder. They may take several weeks to start working. These medications may also cause side-effects, such as
        headaches, nausea, or difficulty sleeping. These side effects are usually not severe for most people, especially
        if the dose starts off low and is increased slowly over time. Talk to your doctor about any side effects that
        you have.

    <p>Another type of medication called beta-blockers can help control some of the physical symptoms of panic
        disorder, such as rapid heart rate. Although doctors do not commonly prescribe beta-blockers for panic disorder,
        they may be helpful in certain situations that precede a panic attack.</p>

    <p>Benzodiazepines, which are sedative medications, are powerfully effective in rapidly decreasing panic attack
        symptoms, but they can cause tolerance and dependence if you use them continuously. Therefore, your doctor will
        only prescribe them for brief periods of time if you need them.</p>

    <p>Your doctor will work with you to find the best medication and dose for you.</p>

    <p>Don’t give up on treatment too quickly. Both psychotherapy and medication can take some time to work. A healthy
        lifestyle can also help combat panic disorder. Make sure to get enough sleep and exercise, eat a healthy diet,
        and turn to family and friends who you trust for support.</p>
